## Slide 1
Hello everyone, I'm very glad to be here, and again welcome to this first famo.us meetup in TLV.
I must admit that it is also my very first meetup as a presenter, so I'm double excited.

Today I want to show you some cool stuff about famous and especially famous angular, but before we begin, I have a couple of announcements
First I have put together a meetup a another kind. It's called Russian Combat, and it s a form a self defense martial art similar to Krav Maga. It is very effective, and we have the chance
to have in Israel one of the best expert. So whenever you have an issue you can't solve with your code, it's a very effective way to release the frustration and sweat a bit.
Get in touch with me and i'll give you all the details.

So let's talk about famous.

So my name is Avi, you can see some of my details here. I've been an Entrepreneur slash CTO for the past 15 years. 3 years ago I sold my last company called Vizelia to one og the giant actor in the Green: Schneider Electric. 
Vizelia was developping a dashboard HTML5 platform for monitoring the Energy consumption in big buildings. And we used Sencha to build it.
How many of you are working in a startup ? Well you'll agree with me that one of the dream you have when you start a new company, like in the back of you're mind, you have is that it would be so cool to eventually sell it. But the question you never asked yourself 
is what do you do after you sold it. Because you know you kinda lost your baby...
So today I have the answer. In order to battle to post aquisition depression phase, the best thing to do is to start from the beginning.
And that's exactly what we did. 

We started a new company called Yoobic about 1 year ago.
The goal of Yoobic is to provide to corporate brand companies a mobile app, so they can ask the crowd to retreive for them field data. Like how are they doing in physical shops.
We call the mission Quests, and users can dedicated 10 mins of their time to take a survey while their are in the stores, with a few simple questions, so that the brand can get instant
feedback. And they get paid for that around 5 to 10 euros
The product was built using Ionic and angular, and we are in the process or re writing it with famous.
Also we are activly recruting so if you are looking for new opportunities do not hesitate to get in touch with me.

So what is the situation today if you wanna build a mobile app. You have several platforms, and one of your first choice could be to develop natively for those platforms.
And actually a lot of companies are still doing that. But as a startup you have limited resources, and you want to got live as soon as possible.
So the question is "is there a better way to achieve that"? And actually building an hybrid application seems like a very good fit. Because you reuse the same base code across all of the devices
So it is cheaper and both faster to develop.

But there is still some confusion about hybrid apps.
In 2012, Mark Zuckerberg declared that he should have bet on HTML5 over native.

And i remember that i was kind of chocking statement... It was about 5 or 6 years that i was developping a HTML 5 application (for the browser not mobile of course). And it was a lot more effective than the desktop application that we add before.
And in many aspect it reminds me of the debate between web app and desktop app like in 2000. Only in a very specific situation you should choose to go with desktop.
So when i read the statement my first reaction was a bit like that.
and then like that.

So there is a lot of controversy about what exacly Mark Zuckerberg meant. And you should be confident that the gap between native and mobile is rapidly decreasing. 
and famous help us do a few more steps in that direction.

So how does famous compare to other HTML5 / javascript frameworks.
If you look at the left column you see like the old way of doing things. Sencha and Kendo would be example of full stack javascript framework where you get everything out of the box.
The abstraction of the dom, the architecture with classes and components, and the presentation with UI theme that you have to love or be doomed.

But with the avenement of npm and bower packages, the new way of doing things is that you can choose and cherry pick the framework for a specific task
